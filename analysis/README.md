## Current analyses
	- Cortical thickness distributions based on FreeSurfer output
	- Functional Connectivity metrics based on fMRIPrep output
	- Image quality metrics based on MRIQC output
	
### MRIQC Analysis
	- In order to generate the analysis figures for MRIQC, run the python script with the file path to the tsv files generated by the MRIQC group level analysis
	-  EFC, SNR, DVARS, FD and summary of the background metrics are considered for BOLD data, while for T1w EFC, SNR, FWHM, INU and summary of background are considered
