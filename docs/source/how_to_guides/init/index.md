# Initializing a new dataset

This guide shows how to initialize a new Nipoppy dataset.

```{toctree}

hidden:
includehidden:

bids
non_bids
```

We cover two possible starting scenarios. In both cases, the command to create the dataset is [`nipoppy init`](../../cli_reference/init.rst).

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item-card}  [Starting with non-BIDS data](non_bids)
Initialize a new Nipoppy dataset with source imaging data **not** in {term}`BIDS`
:::
:::{grid-item-card}  [Starting with BIDS data](bids)
