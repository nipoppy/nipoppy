By default, [`nipoppy bidsify`](<project:../../cli_reference/bidsify.rst>), [`nipoppy process`](<project:../../cli_reference/process.rst>), and [`nipoppy extract`](<project:../../cli_reference/extract.rst>) will run every participant-session pair sequentially. This can be very slow for large datasets and suboptimal if more computational resources are available. The following guides show how pipeline runs can be parallelized for different computer/server setups.
