```{admonition} How to read the schema table
---
class: note
---
- Read the table from top to bottom, left to right
- **Required properties** are in **bold**
- The *type* of each property is in *italics*, to the right of a cell labelled "type"
    - Unless if that property is an object described by another schema, in which case it is a link to that schema
- Default values are shown for optional properties (`None` if empty)
- See the [JSON schema docs](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/) more details about keyword meanings
```
